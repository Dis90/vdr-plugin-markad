Description:

MarkAd marks advertisements in VDR recordings.


Command line options:
   A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
   Available options:

     -b DIR,   --bindir=DIR          use DIR as location for markad executable
                                     (default: /usr/bin)
     -l DIR    --logocachedir=DIR    use DIR as location for markad logos
                                     (default: /var/lib/markad)

               --astopoffs=SECONDS   assume stop of the recording SECONDS after the end of the EPG time.
                                     default is 0 s
                                     If end marks are to early, try to add some seconds

               --cut                 cut video based on marks and write it in the recording directory
                                     there are no splits of the target file, make sure your filesystem can handle big files

               --ac3reencode         re-encode AC3 stream to fix low audio level of cutted video on same devices
                                     requires --cut

               --autologo=<option>   0 = disable, only use logos from logo cache directory (default)
                                     1 = enable, if there is no suitable logo in the logo cache directroy
                                         find logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                                         memory usage optimized operation mode, but runs slow
                                     2 = enable, if there is no suitable logo in the logo cache directroy
                                         find logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                                         speed optimized operation mode, but needs a lot of memonry, use it only > 1 GB memory
                                     If this option is set you can not configure this feature from the VDR menue
