Description:

MarkAd marks advertisements in VDR recordings.


Command line options:
   A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
   Available options:

     -b DIR,   --bindir=DIR          use DIR as location for markad executable
                                     (default: /usr/bin)
     -l DIR    --logocachedir=DIR    use DIR as location for markad logos
                                     (default: /var/lib/markad)

               --astopoffs=SECONDS   assume stop of the recording SECONDS after the end of the EPG time.
                                     default is 100 s
                                     If end marks are to early, try to add some seconds

               --cDecoder            use the alternative decoder

               --cut                 cut video based on marks and write it in the recording directory
                                     requires --cDecoder
                                     there are no splits of the target file, make sure your filesystem can handle big files

               --ac3reencode         re-encode AC3 stream to fix low audio level of cutted video on same devices
                                     requires --cDecoder and --cut

               --autologo=<option>   0 = disable, only use logos from logo cache directory (default)
                                     1 = enable, find logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                                         memory usage optimized operation mode, but runs slow
                                     2 = enable, find logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                                         speed optimized operation mode, but needs a lot of memonry, use it only > 1 GB memory



If you use the alternative decoder these are the recommended plugin default settings. This parameters will pass through to the markad command.
Put these lines into your markad plugin configuration, usually stored in /etc/vdr/conf.d:

[markad]
--astopoffs=0
--cDecoder
