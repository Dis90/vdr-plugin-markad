Description:

MarkAd marks advertisements in VDR recordings.


Command line options:
   A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
   Available options:

     -b DIR,   --bindir=DIR        use DIR as location for markad executable
                                   (default: /usr/bin)
     -l DIR    --logocachedir=DIR  use DIR as location for markad logos
                                   (default: /var/lib/markad)

if you want to use the new decoder this are the recommended plugin default settings. This parameters will pass through to the markad command:

assume stop of the recording at the end of the EPG time. If end marks are to early, try to add some seconds
--astopoffs=0

use the new decoder code
--cDecoder

put these lines into your markad plugin configuration, usually stored in /etc/vdr/conf.d:

[markad]
--astopoffs=0
--cDecoder
